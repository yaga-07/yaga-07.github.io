            <h2>Early Foundations: The 1940s to 1980s</h2>
            <p>
                Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has revolutionized various fields, from image recognition to natural language processing. But how did this groundbreaking technology come into existence? The journey of deep learning is rooted in the development of artificial neural networks, which mimic the human brain's structure and function. This blog will take you through the key milestones that led to the inception of deep learning, highlighting the contributions of pioneers, major breakthroughs, and the challenges faced along the way.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The conceptual foundations of neural networks can be traced back to the 1940s with the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who proposed a model of artificial neurons. Their work laid the groundwork for later developments in neural network theory.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb introduced the Hebbian Learning Rule in his book <i>The Organization of Behavior</i>. This principle, often summarized as "cells that fire together, wire together," described how synaptic connections between neurons could be strengthened through repeated activations. Hebb's rule was instrumental in the development of later neural network models.

            <p>
                During the 1960s, Soviet mathematician Alexey Ivakhnenko, along with his colleague Valentin Lapa, created one of the first artificial neural networks capable of learning through the method of group method of data handling (GMDH). Ivakhnenkoâ€™s work is often regarded as an early form of deep learning, even though the term itself wouldn't be coined for several decades.

            <h2>The Rise of Neural Networks: The 1980s to 1990s</h2>
            <p>
                The 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in neural networks, largely due to the work of John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton. Hopfield introduced recurrent neural networks, which allowed for the modeling of dynamic systems. Hinton, along with David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams, developed the backpropagation algorithm, a significant breakthrough that enabled the training of deep neural networks by efficiently computing gradients.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yann LeCun's work in 1989 on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) marked another critical milestone. His LeNet architecture, designed for handwritten digit recognition, demonstrated the practical potential of neural networks and laid the foundation for future advances in computer vision.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite these advancements, the field faced challenges, including the notorious "AI winter" of the 1990s, a period marked by reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence due to unmet expectations. However, a few researchers continued to push the boundaries, leading to significant developments in the following decades.
            </p>

            <h2>The Deep Learning Revolution: 2000s to Present</h2>
            <p>
                The turn of the millennium brought with it faster processors and the advent of GPUs, which significantly accelerated the training of deep neural networks. In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton coined the term "deep learning" and demonstrated that deep networks could be pre-trained layer by layer using unsupervised learning, followed by fine-tuning with supervised learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most pivotal moments in the history of deep learning occurred in 2012 when a team led by Hinton won the ImageNet competition using a deep convolutional neural network called AlexNet. This victory showcased the power of deep learning in image recognition tasks and spurred widespread adoption of the technology in various domains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, deep learning has continued to evolve, with advancements in architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and more. These developments have enabled applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to AI-driven drug discovery.
            </p>

            <h2>Mathematical Formulation: The Backbone of Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>
                At its core, deep learning involves the use of neural networks to approximate complex functions. The fundamental building block of these networks is the artificial neuron, which computes a weighted sum of its inputs, passes it through an activation function, and produces an output.
            </p>

            <p>
                The learning process involves adjusting the weights \( w \) of the network to minimize a loss function \( L \), which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual target. This is typically done using gradient descent, where the weights are updated according to the rule:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[
                \Delta w = -\eta \nabla_w L
                \]
            </p>

            <p>
                where \( \eta \) is the learning rate, and \( \nabla_w L \) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.
            </p>

            <p>
                Backpropagation, introduced in the 1980s, efficiently computes these gradients using the chain rule of calculus, enabling the training of deep networks with many layers.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The inception of deep learning is a story of perseverance, innovation, and collaboration across multiple decades. From the early theoretical work on artificial neurons to the modern-day successes of deep learning applications, the field has come a long way. As computing power continues to grow and new techniques are developed, the potential of deep learning remains boundless, promising to unlock new frontiers in science, technology, and beyond.
